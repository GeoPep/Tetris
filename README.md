This is a Tetris game I created myself using python and pygame/simpleaudio modules.
This project was created without using object oriented programming.
Game music is from original Tetris game, and I DO NOT OWN THE MUSIC.
The game uses data from data folder. Boxes were created using Windows Paint.
Also, the game uses config.dat file in order to store the game options and high score.
The game is available in two screen resolutions. 525x675 and 600x900.
I used simpleaudio for playing sound because i had some compile errors with pygame.
Game was finished on 13 October 2020 by GeoPep and uploaded on GitHub https://github.com/GeoPep

I have upoaded tetris.py source code, data folder, and the windows executable.
Data folder must be in same location with the executable.
